# concept: SuggestChord

* **concept**: SuggestChord

* **purpose**: offer users suggestions for suitable chords to place in any position of a progression.

* **principle**: when a user selects a slot in a sequence, the system analyzes the context—the units before and after that slot— and generates a list of candidate units that would fit well in that position. If the sequence is empty, the system provides starting units. If the slot is at the end, the system suggests conappltinuations.

* **state**:
  * A `Key` of type `String`
  * A sequnce of `Chords` with type `String` or `null` if no chord is set at a particular position

* **actions**:
  * `suggestProgression(length: Number, key: String): (String[])`
    * **requires** `length >= 0`, `key` is a key in standard music notation
    * **effect** returns a chord progression of length `length` in key `key`, generated by an LLM.
  * `suggestChord(chords: (String | null)[], position: Number): (String[])`
    * **requires**: every `chord` is a valid chord in standard music notation or `null`, `position` is a valid index in the `chords` array
    * **effect**: returns a list of suggested chords to put in `position`, generated by an LLM given the context of the chords before and after it and the key.
